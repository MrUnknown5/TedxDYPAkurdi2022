            <h3>ABOUT TED</h3>
            <p>TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). TED is a global community, welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world. We believe passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world.</p>

            <h3>ABOUT TEDx</h3>
            <p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxDYPAkurdi, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxDYPAkurdi event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p>

            <h3>UNIVOCAL</h3>
            <p>The contrariety that lurks around our mind with flamboyant wings can only be nullified by a univocal approach. In a world full of ambiguous connotations, the incongruous battle between our rationale versus our sensation makes it difficult to focus on a specific conclusion. A definitive language thus gradually becomes the need of the hour. To chase away the dichotomy of the universe, we opt for an unambiguous philosophy that leads our way. Our dubious proposition relies on the univocality of our action for a befitting aftermath. For creating a world of unquestionable opportunity, we have to adhere to a particular belief system. A particular set of etiquettes is a prerequisite for reaching a discrete objective. In the arena owned by the implicit territory, only the explicit can prevail through its unrestrained force and rule like a sovereign.</p>
